  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Court Vision ("the Bot") handles information when you use it within Discord servers.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Server and Channel IDs:</strong> Used to determine where to send updates and alerts.</li>
    <li><strong>User IDs:</strong> Collected temporarily when slash commands are used, for context and response routing.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Pulled from the NBA’s public APIs to deliver scores, standings, and stats.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We only use collected data to provide real-time NBA updates and bot functionality within your Discord server. None of this information is shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We do not store personal information permanently. Temporary state is cached in memory or local files to improve performance and avoid duplicate messages. No user messages or conversations are logged.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No collected data is sold, shared, or transferred to third parties. Your server data remains private and is only used by the bot as necessary for features to function.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or would like your server’s data removed from cache, please contact us at: <strong>thecourtvisionbasketball@gmail.com</strong></p>

  <p>This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the bot implies acceptance of the latest version.</p>
